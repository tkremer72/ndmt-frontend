# New Driver Mile Tracker Application

#	The goal of the New Driver Mile Tracker Application is to provide young, unlicensed drivers with a way to keep track of the supervised miles they drive by using manual entry, and geo tracking to log and calculate the number of hours they have driven.  

#	The app should also provide a way to upload images of the odometer both before and after driving supervised miles.  


#	In addition to keeping track of miles for the driver, the app should provide a way to verify that the young driver is registered to drive under supervision, provide a way for the supervising driver to upload an image of their license and show that they are legal guardians or legally authorized by the guardians to supervise their young driver.   Or the app should communicate through an API with the DMV to acquire these verifications.

#	Lastly the app should provide a way to print out all of the forms as well as a final summery for each new driversâ€™ hours driven, their legal information, and the supervising drivers signature, both digital and handwritten.  The end goal is to get the application to a place where all the above can be done through the application digitally.
